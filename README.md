# cs-230-software-design-template

The client, The Gaming Room, needs an application mimicking the television game “Win, Lose, or Draw”. It needed the ability to have multiple teams with multiple players involved. Only one instance of the game can be in memory at one time. It needs to be able to operate on multiple platforms.
I’m not sure if I did one thing particularly well when compared to other pieces of the project.  I have never been great at documentation of anything.  It is always a struggle for me.  Developing this software design template helped with organization of coding for the project. I would probably revise the whole document when given the chance.  I am never happy with a first, second, or third draft.  I like to continuously improve!
The users were always part of the consideration when developing this.  If the user does not have a good time with the game, it will fall by the wayside very quickly.  As far as developing the software, I like to work on bits and pieces and test as I go.  This hopefully helps catch any errors before they get too far out of hand.  This is the way I always have built lines of code.  It also helps to see what each line actually does.
